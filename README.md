# TTK4155---Embedded-and-Industrial-Computer-Systems-Design
The TTK4155 Term Project involves creating a computer-controlled electromechanical ping pong game. The project is comprehensive, requiring substantial lab work throughout the semester. It is structured into smaller weekly exercises for manageable progression.

## System Overview
The system is structured into two main parts, Node 1 and Node 2, which communicate via a CAN bus.

- **Node 1**: Consists of a breadboard integrating an ATmega162 microcontroller with various components including an A/D converter for joystick and touch inputs, SRAM for additional memory, an OLED display for user interface, and a MAX233 for RS232 communication.

- **Node 2**: Built around an Arduino Due with an ATSAM3X8e microcontroller and includes a BT840 for Bluetooth connectivity, logic level converters, an OpAmp for signal amplification, and interfaces to control a servo and solenoid for physical movements in the game.
